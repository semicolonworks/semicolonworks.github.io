<p><a href="http://tinhnguyenlonghoa.org">tinhnguyenlonghoa.org</a> has finally launched this past week.</p>
<p>It is my first work for a non-profit, and I am very proud to do my part and help out a friend. I&#8217;ve known Minh, the project director, for a while. We did a community service trip in Vietnam together more than 4 years ago, not too different from Long Hoa. Since then I&#8217;ve gained a lot of respect for him and his dedication to community service.</p>
<p>This site features a simple, minimal design with a focus on pictures as a way to tell the story. Here are some nice aspects of the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple, minimal and <strong>responsive</strong> design.</li>
<li>Responsive <strong>image sliders</strong> integrated with <strong>lightbox</strong> &#8211; I want the audience to be able to easily browse through the images &#8211; the main assets of the site &#8211; and at the same time look at them in more details.</li>
<li>Integration with <strong>Facebook</strong>, including a Like box and Comments. The project&#8217;s Facebook page has been the main driver for social outreach, and it should continue leveraging that strength.</li>
<li>Friendly <strong>content management</strong> backend, relying on the powerful WordPress admin, coupled with Advanced Custom Fields and other great plugins.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also my first site in Vietnamese, which imposes an interesting restriction on fonts. There are only 3 fonts from <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts">Google Web Fonts</a> that fully support the Vietnamese characters. I lucked out as Open Sans, my favorite font, supports the Vietnamese language.</p>
<p>Working with Minh has been a very pleasant experience. He is always on top with his part of the project, providing content and images very early on. This allowed me to have a good grasp on the content and design to maximize their impact. He is also flexible in working with me in developing solutions for various ideas.</p>
<p>There are certain areas of the site that could be further optimized/ revisited for better performance and user experience. Hopefully these will be tackled on soon as the site gains more traffic and has more user testing.</p>
<p>This site is also the first to be hosted with <a href="http://pagodabox.com/">pagodabox</a> (wow! there are many firsts with this project!). I really like the object-oriented approach to hosting and the version control (<code>git</code>) built in from the start. However, I had to jump through a few hoops to get WordPress working correctly on there, such as configuring writable directories, syncing with local development (.htaccess for permalink) or WP Super Cache plugin &#8211; these warrant their own post.</p>
<p>Enjoy looking through the site (my apologies in advance for the cryptic and weird Google Translation &#8211; Google definitely needs to work on their translation machine for English &#8211; Vietnamese) and let me know if you have any suggestions/ comments.</p>
