<p>Today marks an important milestone in my developer career: I have successfully managed to get started with Git and Github, including creating my first repo and pushed changes to it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of how I did it (references for my future self).</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h2>1. Install git</h2>
<p>I downloaded the <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Mac installer</a> and run the install.<br />
<strong>First challenge</strong>: Mac by default uses its own version of git, which is stored in <code>/usr/bin</code>, while the git installer install git in a different directory <code>/usr/local/bin/git/bin</code>.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can check out which version your Mac is using by typing this into Terminal <code>git --version</code> and <code>which git</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t really figure out how to change this to make it work. So what I ended up doing was delete the default <code>git</code> file by <code>rm /usr/bin/git</code> and create a symbolic link from the new git to the old git <code>ln -s /usr/local/bin/git/bin/git /usr/bin</code>.</p>
<p>However, even without creating the symlink, Terminal will still search <code>/usr/local/</code> by default to find git.</p>
<p>##2. Get started using git</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/101-lets-suck-at-github-together/">Chris Coyier&#8217;s screencast tutorial</a> on how to get started using Git by cloning a local project, created a new repo on github.com and upload the local project to the remote repo.</p>
<p>##3. Deploying from git</p>
<p>The first git repo I created was a website project I&#8217;ve been developing locally. I wanted to use git so that other people could start helping me work on it.<br />
The natural next step for me was to figure out how I could deploy my git commits to a remote server through FTP.<br />
My first thought was using a git hook <code>post-receive</code>, but it seemed awfully complex and difficult.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion">Dandelion</a> is a much nicer and easier tool to use to deploy. I followed the guide to install it on my Mac and created the config file for each git repo.</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>sudo gem install dandelion</code>, and not just <code>gem install dandelion</code></li>
<li>For the <code>exclude</code> files in config, there should be no tab before the dash &#8211; character or it won&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>The first deployment might take a while, depending on the size of your repository. But after that, Dandelion is smart enough to only deploy the files that have been added/ changed/ deleted, so it is really quick.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Workflow</h2>
<p>Now, my new work flow includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making changes to my working directory</li>
<li><code>git commit -m 'commit message'</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin master</code></li>
<li><code>dandelion deploy</code></li>
</ol>
<p>While it is true that I can&#8217;t use automatic deployment with dandelion, I actually prefer to deploy manually like this. I think this would come in handy if I realized that I had made a mistake after a push, I could still go back and make changes before deploying it to my web server.</p>
<p>Another advantage to using this method is that I am deploying from my local git repo. This means that I could push certain files to the server without having them included in the public repo.</p>
