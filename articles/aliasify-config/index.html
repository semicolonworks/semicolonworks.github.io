			<h1>Use aliasify to include configurations in your web application</h1>

<p>As I build more web applications, one problem that I keep running into is how to include application configurations into the application source code.</p>
<h3>What do I mean by configurations?</h3>
<p>They include application-specific settings such as the application name, API URL, debug mode etc. These are metadata to the application, similar to the metadata contained in <code>package.json</code> for a Node module.</p>
<p>As I develop most of my applications locally, some of these settings will differ when the application is served on localhost versus when served in production. For eg., I usualy use a staging API server for local development and then a production server for deployment.</p>
<h3>I could certainly hardcode these settings into the source code right?</h3>
<p>The fact that I need 2 (or more) environment-specific versions of these settings make them difficult to be hardcoded. Furthermore, as a developer, I feel a little &#8220;dirty&#8221; when I hardcode these settings. Ideally, they should be declared in a JSON file somewhere, just like <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<h3>There must be other solutions out there!</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, there isn&#8217;t a good straight forward solution out there, as far as I know (if you know of one, please leave a comment). Here are a few worth mentioning:</p>
<p>One can follow the approach outlined by Addy Osmani in <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/environment-specific-builds-with-grunt-gulp-or-broccoli/">making environment-specific builds with build tools</a> and use some sort of string replacement plugin. However, this will introduce some &#8216;not-so-pretty&#8217; delimiters in the codebase, such as <code>@@foo</code> used by grunt-replace.</p>
<p>Henrik Joreteg&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/clientconfig">clientconfig</a> is another elegant solution and very close to what I have in mind, however it relies on a server component to set all the configurations in a cookie. This is not a hard requirement, but is not feasible for a static site running on a simple file server (such as Github Pages) like this blog.</p>
<h3>Another attempt at solving this problem</h3>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> to bundle your JavaScript code, this might be a good solution for you.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/benbria/aliasify">aliasify</a>, you can require your config, which is declared in a <code>config.json</code> file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "API_URL": "http://example_server.com/api",
  "env": "development"
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var config = require('config');

console.log(config.API_URL); //prints out API_URL
if (config.env === 'development') {
  // do something specifically in development mode
}
</code></pre>
<p>To declare this transformation, you can add the following section to <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "aliasify": {
    aliases: {
      "config": "./config.json"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple, right?</p>
<h3>Environment-specific configs</h3>
<p>We can make this even better, by allowing for environment-sepcific configs. To do that, I recommend using a build tool like grunt or gulp. I am sure there is probably a way to do it with just the simple browserify command line interface, but using browserify programmatically makes things a lot easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how I am using this in a recent project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// gulpfile.js

// enable development mode
var dev = false;
gulp.task('enable-dev-mode', function () {
  dev = true;
});

gulp.task('scripts', function () {
  // set up browserify bundle in here
  // see https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/browserify-uglify-sourcemap.md

  // aliasify config
  var aliasify = require('aliasify').configure({
  aliases: {
    'config': './config' + (dev ? '.dev' : '') + '.json'
  },
  configDir: __dirname
  })
  bundler.transform(aliasify);
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this approach, aliasify will automatically use <code>config.dev.json</code> for development environment and <code>config.json</code> for production one.</p>
<p>A similar approach could be taken when using <a href="https://github.com/jmreidy/grunt-browserify">grunt-browserify</a>. In fact, it is probably easier to do environment-specific stuff with grunt due to its ability to declare a task target.</p>
<p>There you have it, a simple approach to accessing environment configuations in your project that is made possible by browserify.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s bad, what&#8217;s good, what could be better?</h3>
<p>This solution&#8217;s downside is relying on browserify (and possibly a build system), which might not be applicable for an older project. If you use RequireJS/AMD, I imagine it&#8217;d be similarly easy to include such a config file using the <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/requirejs-plugins">JSON plugin</a>.</p>
<p>One possible improvement to this solution is allowing the ability to cascade configs across environment. For example:</p>
<p>In <code>config.json</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "appName": "FooBar",
  "apiUrl": "http://foobar.com/api"
}
</code></pre>
<p>And then <code>config.dev.json</code> just &#8220;extend&#8221; it without redeclaring common configs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is currently not possible with using aliasify. I have implemented a similar version of this as a grunt task for <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/tobiko#configjson">tobiko</a>, but it&#8217;s not polished enough to be used by others yet. I will update this space if and when this becomes available.</p>
