			<h1>Adding Responsive Lightbox to WordPress</h1>
			<div class="article-date">08-04-2015</div>
<p>I have finally got around to update all the images on this blog to make use of Lightbox. Woohoo!</p>
<p>Lightbox has been around for a while, and there are many WordPress plugins that allow you to automatically update your blog with it.</p>
<p>However, I have found them to not be very satisfactory for a few reasons. None of them take advantage of the latest version of lightbox plugins. My personal favorite is <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/">fancyBox</a>, which is responsive as well. Most of them are not responsive, and none of them allows you to group all the images within a post to be in one gallery, which I think is really important.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Following Bryce Adam&#8217;s incredibly helpful WPTuts tutorial on <a href="http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/theme-development/add-a-responsive-lightbox-to-your-wordpress-theme/">Add a Responsive Lightbox to your WordPress Theme</a>, I have been able to implement Lightbox on my blog using the latest version of fancyBox. As a front-end developer, this is just a much more intuitive approach for me, rather than using a plugin without knowing what it does.</p>
<p>I followed step 1 and 2 but implemented step 3 a little differently to allow my version to automatically add all images within a post to the same gallery. I know that WordPress has a built-in gallery function, but I don&#8217;t use it that often and much prefer adding single image as I need to.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my version of the Javacript file:</p>
<pre><code class="js">// Initialize the Lightbox for any links with the 'fancybox' class
$(".fancybox").fancybox();
$('article').each(function() {
    var id = $(this).attr('id');
    // add fancybox class to any .jpg, .png, .jpeg and .gif file, as well as a rel attribute to denote that it belongs to a certain post
    $("a[href$='.jpg'], a[href$='.png'], a[href$='.jpeg'], a[href$='.gif']", this).attr('rel', id).addClass("fancybox");
});
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not sure of the unusual jQuery selector, it means <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/303956/jquery-select-a-which-href-contains-some-string">selecting an anchor tag <code>a</code> element with <code>href</code> attribute that ends with <code>.png</code></a> etc.</p>
<p>As an example, here are some pictures I&#8217;ve taken from my recent trip to Chicago that I would like to share. All I did is using the regular WordPress media uploader to import the pictures, without any Gallery configuration.</p>

<p>P/S: Writing this post has finally made me sit down and implemented <a href="http://prismjs.com">prism.js</a> for this website too! It is actually quite easy to do. DOUBLE WIN!</p>
