<p>In this video, John Cleese explains how we all can achieve some creativity in our daily life, and does so with a great sense of humor and conviction. This is perhaps one of the best speeches I&#8217;ve listened to this year (and considering that January is only closing, there&#8217;s not much competition). As one of the commenters said, if this was on TED, it would be one of the most popular one.</p>

<p>Some of the great ideas I gleaned from watching this, although to be honest any sentence said by him in this talk is quote-worthy, including the lightbulb jokes, are that <em>It is easier to do small things we know how to do that are urgent than to do big things that we&#8217;re unsure of, like thinking</em> and <em>Some of the most creative people are able to stick with a problem longer and deal with the discomfort, than those who are supposed to be &#8220;decisive&#8221;</em>. These ideas resonate well with me in my daily life.</p>
<p>P/S: You can&#8217;t help but like a guy who has such a cute and cool website <a href="http://www.thejohncleese.com/">www.thejohncleese.com</a>. The best part is that it was made with WordPress too!</p>
