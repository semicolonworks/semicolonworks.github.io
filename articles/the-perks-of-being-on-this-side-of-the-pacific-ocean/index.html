<p><a href="https://twitter.com/crushgear">Steph Yiu</a> wrote a fantastic blog post about what she considers <a href="http://www.hoppycow.com/post/35126924731/the-little-privileges-you-get-by-living-in-the-usa">The Little Privileges You Get By Living In The USA</a>, some of which I whole-heartedly agree with. These are the thoughts that go in my mind daily and I&#8217;m happy someone has so well articulated and published it on the web.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Steph&#8217;s list of 10 perks, check out the post for her full description of each perk, which I thought were light-hearted, honest and insightful observations.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You can Amazon Prime stuff</li>
<li>You can watch TV on Hulu, and movies on Netflix</li>
<li>You can use the iTunes store</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to worry about spoilers</li>
<li>Brands in magazines? They&#8217;re real.</li>
<li>You can buy Reese&#8217;s Pieces</li>
<li>Have stuff to do over the holidays</li>
<li>Britney Spears concerts</li>
<li>The best media the world has to offer.</li>
<li>Vote in the biggest election on the planet.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>To this list, I would only add <strong>Listening to Spotify and Pandora</strong>, which have become my staples for music for quite a while now, and <strong>Getting first dibs at product releases</strong> (think Apple and Android phones, Amazon Kindles etc.), though the latter has been improved with every release cycle.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really get the Birtney Spear concerts, but I do think that there are just a whole lot more concerts here in general, not just big name ones, but even small little ones around the community neighborhoods. And unfortunately I can&#8217;t share Steph&#8217;s joy in being a part of the election, but I share the sentiment nonetheless.</p>
