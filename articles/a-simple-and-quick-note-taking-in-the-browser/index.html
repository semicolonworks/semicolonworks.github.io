<p>There are currently wayyy too many note-taking apps out there, many of them offer very beautiful well-designed interfaces. But with any application, a maturing market calls for simpler ways of doing things. Enter note-taking in your browser!</p>

<h2>Note + Evernote Web Clipper</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple and quick way to take note that could integrate really well with your current note-taking app. I am a big fan of Evernote, so it is what I use to demonstrate.</p>
<p><img src="http://wp.tridnguyen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2013-02-01-at-11.12.31-AM.png" alt="Note in the browser" /></p>
<p>A few days ago, this simple trick about <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq">&#8220;One Line Browser Notepad&#8221;</a> was circling the Twitterverse with a cool tip of how to transform the Chrome (or whichever modern) browser you use into a notepad.</p>
<p>I thought that was quite cool, but wanted to take a step further to make the whole page looks more appealing. I would be more likely to use this feature if it has a nicer more friendly interface to it. So I decided to make it into a more full-blown website,<a href="http://tridnguyen.com/note">Note</a>.</p>
<p>This page, when used with <a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote&#8217;s Web Clipper</a>, integrates really well into my current note-taking flow.</p>
<p>A really nice feature is that it has a Note title, which will automatically rewrite the page title. This was done so that when used with Evernote&#8217;s Web Clipper, the note title is automatically picked up.</p>
<p>The nice lined background for the note part is an adoption from <a href="http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#lined-paper">Lea Verou&#8217;s CSS3 Patterns</a>. This will help the page loads faster than using a background image.</p>
